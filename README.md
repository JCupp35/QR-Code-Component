## Overview
In this project I created a QR code card component using HTML and CSS. I practiced using semantic HTML and using a flexbox layout in CSS, using a figma design file for reference to simulate a front-end development workflow. This project required attention to detail, following design specifications, and using modern web development practices. The component includes an image of a QR code, a bold text heading, and descriptive text that follows the required typography, colors and spacing. As part of my portfolio to demonstrate front-end development skills, this project showcases my abilities to translate design files into functional webpages.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I reinforced my skills in writing semantic HTML and practiced using the CSS Flexbox layout. I deepened my understanding of the CSS Flexbox by using properties such as justify-content and align-items for even spacing and alignment within the card component. I gained a better understanding of using semantic HTML for accesibility by using elements like `<main> `and `<h1>` to structure the content logically. I learned the importance of setting default margins and paddings and using the border-box property to have more control of the spacing and following the design guidelines more precisely. I learned to translate Figma design specifications into code by replicating typography, colors, and spacing. For example, I used the Outfit font with specific weights and HSL colors to match the designâ€™s visual style.


### Continued development

I will continue expanding my skills using the CSS Flexbox layout as well as the CSS Grid. I want to focus on learning more about the properties of each layout and the proper use cases for using the flex properties, gap, justify-content, etc. Below are some useful resources that I referenced during this project.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me better undestand the Flexbox layout and I will use it as a reference for properly using the properties.
- [Resource 2](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/12-common-css-mistakes-web-developers-make/) - This is an article that taught me about the importance of using CSS resets, overspecificity, and using shorthand properties.
